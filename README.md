# How to run this app


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the app:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/directory
```

Clone the GitHub repository of the Flutter app using git clone command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
Replace username with the GitHub username of the repository owner and repo with the name of the repository.
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd repo
```
Install Dependencies
After cloning the repository, you'll need to install the app's dependencies using flutter pub get:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
This command will fetch and install all the required packages specified in the pubspec.yaml file.

## Run the App
Now that you have all the dependencies installed, you can run the app on a connected device (emulator or physical device) using the following command:
```bash
flutter run
```
This will build and launch the app on your connected device.


## Build the App for Release
To build the Flutter app for release (e.g., for the Google Play Store or Apple App Store), follow these steps:

For Android (APK):
```bash
flutter build apk
```
The generated APK file can be found in the build/app/outputs/apk/release/ directory.

For iOS (IPA):
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```
The generated IPA file can be found in the build/ios/iphoneos/ directory.

## Conclusion
You've successfully cloned and built the Flutter app from GitHub! You can now explore the app's code, make modifications, and run it on your devices.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the app's README.md or consult the project's contributors.
